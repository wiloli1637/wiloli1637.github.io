  I myself am a dancer and I&rsquo;ve been dancing since the age of 4. I&rsquo;ve always thought of dancing as a way to express yourself in ways you usually wouldn&rsquo;t be able to. Dancing is also a useful tool in decompressing and helping concentration. Dancing helps me with my patience, focus, and overall fitness. The wonderful thing about dance is that with the wide variety you can almost always find one type that interests you.Â </span></p>
