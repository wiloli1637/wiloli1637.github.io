        <p>Jazz is used on dance television shows, music videos, and commercials. Jazz is easy to like and enjoyable to watch because of its upbeat and abstract style. Jazz is a form of dance that presents an individual&rsquo;s individuality and add jumpy and sharp movements. It also includes leaps, turns, as well as moves made up over time. To succeed in jazz, you must know and understand ballet and have a strong focus and flexibility. </p>

          The clothing for a jazz dance class are loose and comfortable to be able to easily move. Dancers choose their own clothing to assist in expressing themselves. It is encouraged to have your body lines showing so usually leggings or jazz pants are worn. Sometimes shorts are worn, but again it&rsquo;s all about personal preference. Shirts for jazz include tank tops, t-shirts or sports bras. <br>
        </p>
        <p>In jazz classes, even the warm ups have plenty of energy. With upbeat music and wide ranges of stretches, from head isolations to ankle rotations. Isolations are moving one part of the body while the rest of the body remains still. Jazz dancers also work on holding positions for long periods of time. Extension and quick steps are vital to distinguish jazz dances from other dance styles. </p>
